# postgesql-vet-clinic

> This project is a PostgreSQL exercise done as part of the the Microverse Ruby curriculum. The exercise is to create a database, create a database table, insert data into the database table, and select data from the database table


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
